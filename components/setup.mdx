_(If you are reading this please call me. I'd love to help you set everything up. I spent a lot of time working all of this out so it would make me happy to see it being used.)_

Okay there are actually kinda 2 ways to get books on your kindle for free. One of them is to send files by email. One is to load files by USB from a computer.

# The Email Method

This method is slightly trickier to set up but more convenient. It requires your kindle to be connected to internet (not all the time, just when you want a book). There is a limitation of sending books size 25mb and smaller (email attachment max). This is _usually_ not an issue.

### FIRST: Allow my email to send books to your kindle

- Go to this site [https://www.amazon.com/mn/dcw/myx.html/ref=kinw_myk_redirect#/home/settings/payment](https://www.amazon.com/mn/dcw/myx.html/ref=kinw_myk_redirect#/home/settings/payment)

- Click on the `Preferences` tab (you might already be there)

![Preferences](/preferences.png)

- Scroll down to `Personal Document Settings`.

- Under `Approved Personal Document Email List`, select `Add a new approved e-mail address`

![Add Email](/addemail.png)

- Enter sam@theosbornebookshelf.com

### SECOND: Register an account on The Osborne Bookshelf

- Go to [https://books.theosbornebookshelf.com](https://books.theosbornebookshelf.com)

- Create an account

### THIRD: Add your send-to-kindle email address to your Osborne Bookshelf account

- Find your kindle's unique email address at the same place as the FIRST step

  - Go to this site [https://www.amazon.com/mn/dcw/myx.html/ref=kinw_myk_redirect#/home/settings/payment](https://www.amazon.com/mn/dcw/myx.html/ref=kinw_myk_redirect#/home/settings/payment)

  - Click on the `Preferences` tab (you might already be there)

  - Scroll down to `Personal Document Settings`

  - Under `Send-to-Kindle E-Mail Settings` find your kindle's email address

- Back on [The Osborne Bookshelf](https://books.theosbornebookshelf.com/me), go to your [account settings](https://books.theosbornebookshelf.com/me)

- Paste your kindle's email address in the `Send to Kindle E-mail Address` field

### Congratulations

Now you can browse books on The Osborne Bookshelf website and click `Send to Kindle`

# The USB Computer Method

This method is slightly easier to set up. It doesn't require your kindle to ever connect to the internet. You can transfer any size books. But any time you want to transfer books you have to connect to a computer, so less convenient.

### FIRST: Download Calibre to your laptop/desktop

- Calibre is the go-to computer software for managing eBooks. Download it here [https://calibre-ebook.com/download](https://calibre-ebook.com/download)
